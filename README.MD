# Example rest api app

This is an example app based on Symfony 4.4. All requests to change/update/create/listing are according to CQRS commands and structure simply based on DDD. Scripts are written on TDD with the following SOLID rules. 

# Features
  - Endpoints to listing, create, update, delete **products**. Cart entity is planned at todo tasks.
  - Run app by one docker-compose command
  - Support xdebug, phpunit, opcache
  - latest **PHP 7.4** with :heart: typed properties
  - **data fixtures** to purge and insert fresh products ( for more, read below )

# Todo
 - [ ] Cart entity ( add cart, assign and remove products, listing )
 - [ ] Swagger api documentation
 - [ ] Redux components to font-end app
 - [ ] Refactor App.js to different scripts, DRY
 - [ ] JWT auth
 - [ ] git hooks
 - [ ] support string price and parse to <int>

# Run

Clone repository to empty directory:
`git clone https://github.com/karol-bialkowski/rest-api.git .`

Make sure if your docker service is running:
`sudo service docker status`
If in the response you can see `active: (running)` all is okay. If no - try run/restart:
`sudo service docker start/restart`

Go to the directory of repository and run:
`docker-compose build` and next `docker-compose up -d`. 


**If docker-command not work, try to add docker group to sudo, or run with sudo permissions*

Run migrations:
`docker-compose exec php php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force`

Run fixtures:
`docker-compose exec php php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load`

Make sure if in you .env file is declared:
`DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:root@mysql:3306/sf4?serverVersion=5.7`

Run `docker-compose exec composer install` or `docker-compose exec composer install --no-dev` if you don`t want dev dependencies. 

And if all before commands work correctly, visit http://127.0.0.1. 


*Added:*
I set `SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER=disabled` because now in Symfony 4.4 Doctrine has some deprecations and you can see many warnings in this doctrine version.  


# API endpoints

If you use PhpStorm ( or different IDE with support .http files ) you can see **/example-requests** directory and show example requests. All endpoints are declared on *src/Shop/Infrastructure/Resources/routes/product.yaml* and return JSON. If you use this api, verify HTTP CODES ( 200 is ok, 404 not found, 400 etc ).


**LISTING**
